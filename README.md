# Rain-alert-app
Based on <a href="https://openweathermap.org/">OPENWEATHER</a> and <a href="https://www.twilio.com/"> Twilio</a>, this project will send an alert to your device whenever there is a chance of rain. This is another project I learned to make from Angela Yu's #100DaysOfCode.

We have retrieved the weather data from the <a href="https://openweathermap.org/"> OpenWeather </a>API, and to get messages in our phone via text, we used another API from<a href="https://www.twilio.com/"> Twilio</a>. 

<ul>We must first register on both websites in order to receive those API. The next step is to locate the OpenWeather API and API KEY and set those into a variable.</ul>
<ul>We also must register with Twilio using a working email address and a phone number that will be used to get weather alerts in order to acquire API access. The ACCOUNT SID, AUTH TOKEN, and the trial number issued by Twilio must then be obtained. </ul>

  
Keep in mind that this functionality has a price. You will have access to about $15 worth of messages during the trial time to test it out. After that, you must pay for the service if you wish to continue using it.
